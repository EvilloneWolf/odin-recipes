    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 to 6 medium-sized potatoes (500 grams)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons cumin seeds (jeera)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 finely chopped green chilies (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch asafoetida (optional)</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons lemon juice (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, scrub and rinse 5 to 6 medium-sized potatoes (500 grams) in water.</li>
        <li>Boil or steam the potatoes along with ½ teaspoon salt in a stove-top pressure cooker, Instant pot, or a pan, until they are tender and cooked well. Do not overcook or they’ll become mushy!</li>
        <li>For the stovetop pressure cooker, wait until all the pressure falls in the cooker and then remove the lid. For the Instant Pot, do a quick pressure release (QPR) after 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once they are cool enough to touch, peel the skins and chop the potatoes into bite-sized cubes.</li>
        <li>Now it’s time to make the jeera aloo. Firstly, heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and to the hot oil add 3 teaspoons cumin seeds (jeera) and let them crackle for a few seconds as you continuously stir.</li>
        <li>Once the cumin seeds crackle and change color, then add 2 to 3 finely chopped green chilies (1 to 1.5 teaspoons finely chopped green chillies or serrano peppers).</li>
        <li>Stir well to combine the chilies and cumin seeds.</li>
        <li>Next, add the boiled potato cubes to the pan.</li>
        <li>Mix together so that the potato cubes are evenly coated with the cracked cumin seeds and green chilies.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the potatoes with ½ teaspoon of turmeric powder, ½ teaspoon of red chili powder, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Sauté the potatoes for 2 to 3 minutes on low to medium-low heat, stirring often to keep the potatoes from sticking and overcooking.</li>
        <li>Next, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of lemon juice, depending on how much sour flavor you like. Start with 1 teaspoon and taste as you add more to reach the desired level of tanginess.</li>
        <li>Lastly, add 1/4 cup of chopped coriander (cilantro) leaves. Gently mix the coriander into the jeera aloo, and turn off the heat.</li>
    </ol>

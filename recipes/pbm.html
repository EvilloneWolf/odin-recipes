    <p>
        This Paneer Butter Masala recipe is a rich and creamy dish of paneer (Indian cottage cheese) in a tomato,
        butter and cashew sauce that is known here as “makhani gravy.” 
        The acidity of the tomatoes and the sweetness of the cream make for a velvety, nearly addictive sauce.

    <ul>
        <li>Ripe, red & juicy tomatoes</li>
        <li>Raw Cashews</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Paneer</li>
        <li>Spices & Herbs</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Kashmiri red chilli powder</li>
            <li>garam masala powder</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 18 to 20 cashews in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the cashews are soaking, you can prep the other ingredients. It’s time for chopping tomatoes, chopping and preparing the ginger-garlic paste, and slicing paneer into cubes.</li>
        <li>To make the ginger garlic paste, crush a 1-inch piece of peeled ginger with 3 to 4 small to medium-sized garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle. Continue crushing until it is a semi-fine or fine paste. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>After 20 to 30 minutes, drain the water and add the soaked cashews to a blender or mixer-grinder. Also, add 2 to 3 tablespoons fresh water (or as much as is required to blend to a fine paste).</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth paste without any tiny bits or chunks of cashews. Remove the cashew paste from the blender and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same blender, add 2 cups of diced or roughly chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Blend to a smooth tomato puree. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat a thick-bottomed pan or a heavy pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. Add 2 tablespoons (or 3 to 4 tablespoons for a richer version) butter in a pan. Either salted or unsalted butter can be used.</li>
        <li>Keep the heat to a low. Add 1 medium-sized tej patta and fry for 2 to 3 seconds, or until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the prepared crushed ginger-garlic or 1 teaspoon ready-made ginger-garlic paste.</li>
        <li>Sauté until the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic disappears, about 10 to 12 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour in the prepared tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Mix it very well with the butter.</li>
        <li>Begin to cook the tomato purée on a low to medium-low heat. Stir at intervals.</li>
        <li>The tomato purée mixture will start simmering.</li>
        <li>If the tomato purée splutters too much while cooking, then cover the pan partly with a lid or cover fully with a splatter guard (channi lid).</li>
        <li>Continue stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Simmer the purée for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon Kashmiri red chili powder or deghi mirch.</li>
        <li>Mix well and continue to stir and sauté the tomato purée.</li>
        <li>Sauté till the butter starts leaving the sides of the pan and the entire tomato purée mixture comes together as more of a thick paste.</li>
        <li>Now add the prepared cashew paste.</li>
        <li>Mix the cashew paste very well with the cooked tomato puree and continue to stir and sauté on a low to medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Sauté until the cashew paste is cooked and the oil begins to leave the sides of the masala. The cashew will cook quickly, just around 3 to 4 minutes on a low heat. And don’t forget to keep on stirring non-stop!</li>
        <li>Next add 1.5 cups water.</li>
        <li>Mix the water very well with the tomato-cashew masala. If there are lumps, then break them with a spoon or use a wired whisk for mixing.</li>
        <li>Let the curry simmer and come to a boil on a low to medium-low heat. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>After 2 to 3 mins, add ginger julienne (about 1-inch ginger – cut in thin, matchstick-like strips). Reserve a few for garnishing. The curry will begin to thicken.</li>
        <li>After 3 to 4 minutes, add 1 or 2 slit green chiles.</li>
        <li>Also add salt to taste and, if necessary, ¼ to 1 teaspoon sugar depending on the sourness of the tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix very well and simmer for a minute.</li>
        <li>After the gravy thickens to your desired consistency, then add the paneer cubes (200 or 250 grams).</li>
        <li>Stir and mix the paneer cubes gently in the gravy. You can switch off the heat at this point.</li>
        <li>Now quickly add 1 teaspoon crushed dry fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi leaves) and 1 teaspoon garam masala to the gravy.</li>
        <li>Next add 2 to 3 tablespoons of low-fat or light cream or 1 to 2 tablespoons of heavy whipping cream.</li>
        <li>Stir gently but well. If you haven’t yet, switch off the heat.</li>
        <li>Serve Paneer Butter Masala hot garnished with 1 to 2 tablespoons of chopped coriander leaves (cilantro) and the remaining ginger julienne. You can also drizzle some cream or dot with butter while serving. Enjoy!</li>

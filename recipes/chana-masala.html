    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse 1 cup dried white chickpeas (chana or chole) in fresh water a couple of times. Then soak them overnight or for 8 to 9 hours in 3 cups of water.</li>
        <li>After soaking, drain the water and rinse the soaked chickpeas in fresh water for a couple of times.</li>
        <li>In a 3-liter stovetop pressure cooker, add the chickpeas along with 2 to 3 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Add 2.5 to 3 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles on medium heat until they are well-cooked and soft enough to mash with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add all the whole spices for the chole masala to a pan and roast them on low heat until they become extra browned. Let them cool and then grind them finely in a spice grinder.</li>
        <li>Heat 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan or kadai. Add 1/2 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté briefly until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
        <li>Add 1/3 cup finely chopped onions and sauté until they soften and turn translucent or light brown.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup finely chopped tomatoes and sauté until they soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the mixture.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat and add the powdered spices along with 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder, and 1/4 teaspoon garam masala (optional). Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 2 to 3 slit green chilies and the cooked and drained chickpeas. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and add about 1 to 1.25 cups of reserved stock or water. Stir well.</li>
        <li>For a thinner gravy, cover and simmer on low to medium heat. To thicken the gravy, mash some chickpeas with a spoon or reduce the amount of water. Adjust the consistency to your liking.</li>
        <li>If you didn't add dry pomegranate seeds while roasting the spices, add 1 teaspoon amchur powder (dry mango powder) or 1/2 to 1 teaspoon lemon juice, according to your taste. Stir well.</li>
        <li>Chana Masala is ready to be served. Garnish with chopped onions and cilantro (coriander leaves).</li>
        <li>Serve with Indian bread like bhatura or poori, along with a side of sliced onions, ginger julienne, and lime or lemon wedges.</li>
